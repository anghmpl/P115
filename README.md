# P115
The p115 version of the statistic code is different. 

For this semester, Roland has assigned specific Category A and Category B times. Programs can have time for both categories, or just for one.

There was an error with Arne Rau's PID for FEROS. I corrected it and also assigned 20 h to this run. He does not have specific amounts for FEROS or WFI, so that is completely random. I also reduced his GROND time by that amount.
