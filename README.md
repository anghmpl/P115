# Statistic for P115
+ The P115 version of the statistic code is slightly different compared to the previous versions.

+ For this semester, Roland has assigned specific Category A and Category B times. Programs can have time for both categories, or just for one.

+ **10.04.2025:** There was an error with Arne Rau's PID for FEROS (P115_pi.list). I corrected it and also assigned 20 h to  this run. He does not have specific amounts for FEROS or WFI, so that is completely random. I also reduced his GROND time by that amount.
+ **21.04.2025:** Update of the script with one more calculation of percentages, i.e. time observed s less than Cat. A, even if Cat. B is > 0h (e.g. for Eberhardt).
+ **27.04.2025:** Update how total time for Neuman is calculated
